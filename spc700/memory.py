"""Memory that holds what it held, because hardware never hands over a clean one.

The SPC700 sees a flat sixty four kilobyte space. On a console most of it is the
audio RAM, and that RAM is not cleared at power on: it holds whatever pattern the
parts settle into. Code that reads a byte it never wrote reads that pattern, and
on real hardware that read is a bug waiting for the day the pattern changes.
Memory that begins at zero hides every one of those reads, so nothing here begins
at zero unless a caller asks for it in writing.

Two shapes are offered because the cost of being unclean differs. `Memory` fills
a real buffer, which suits a machine that will touch most of its address space.
`SparseMemory` derives an unwritten byte from its address, which suits a test that
touches a dozen and should not pay for the whole space to do it.
